SoftAssert:


			when we use SoftAssert with Assertall() test was executed but in the console it is showing as failed.
 			it is very usefull for testing perpose
 
 HardAssert or Assert:
 
 			when we use hard assert the movement assert failed it wont allow the oter line to execute
 			so we would not know that the it may be error in the upcoming line
